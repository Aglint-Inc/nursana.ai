Analyze the call transcript for a nurse job application based on the key areas below. Assign a score to each section on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
1 = Very poor (significant issues, failed to meet expectations)
2 = Poor (frequent issues, barely meeting expectations)
3 = Average (some issues, meets basic expectations)
4 = Good (minor issues, exceeds expectations in some areas)
5 = Excellent (no issues, fully meets or exceeds expectations)
Key Areas for Analysis:

 **Communication Gaps:**
 - Evaluate: Look for instances of incomplete, fragmented, or unclear responses. Are there parts of the transcript where the user is interrupted or their speech is inaudible?
 - Score: Assign a score based on the frequency and severity of these gaps. A score of 5 indicates no gaps, while a score of 1 indicates frequent communication issues.

 **Engagement and Responsiveness:**
 - Evaluate: Assess how well the user engages with the agentâ€™s questions. Do they provide direct answers to the questions asked, or do they deflect or avoid them?
 - Score: Assign a score based on their responsiveness. A score of 5 indicates full engagement with all questions, while a score of 1 indicates significant avoidance or disinterest.

 **Ability to Articulate Thoughts (Articulation):**
 - Evaluate: Determine if the user's responses are clear and well-organized. Are they able to provide detailed and meaningful answers? Look for any vague or disjointed statements.
 - Score: Rate their articulation. A score of 5 reflects articulate and coherent responses, while a score of 1 indicates frequent confusion or lack of clarity.

 **Adaptability and Stress Management:**
 - Evaluate: Observe how the user handles repeated or challenging questions. Are they able to adjust their responses appropriately, or do they show signs of stress or frustration?
 - Score: Score their adaptability. A score of 5 means they effectively manage stress and adapt well, while a score of 1 means they struggle under pressure.

 **Agent Interaction:**
 - Evaluate: Analyze how the user interacts with the agent's prompts and support. Do they respond positively to guidance, using it to enhance their answers?
 - Score: Rate their interaction. A score of 5 indicates excellent interaction and responsiveness to prompts, while a score of 1 suggests minimal engagement with the agent's input.

 **Confidence Level:**
 - Evaluate: Assess the user's confidence based on their responses. Do they appear self-assured and assertive, or do they seem hesitant and uncertain?
 - Score: Rate their confidence. A score of 5 reflects high confidence in their responses, while a score of 1 indicates noticeable hesitation.

 **Overall Summary:** Provide an overall_summary that encapsulates the candidate's performance, highlighting key strengths and areas for improvement.
